 Discovery and partial translation; Lüthi, Max. Once Upon a Time; on the Nature of Fairy Tales. New York: F. Ungar Pub. Co., 1970. 
 
  
 
 Additional Translation by Megan McLaughlin, 2023 
 
 Originally transcribed in the mid 16th century, this fairy tale comes to us from the Alsace-Lorraine region between modern day France and Germany. 
 
  
 
 In the 17th and 18th centuries, later editions of folktale anthologies included the story, among them Martin Montanus’ “Schwankbücher,” which was originally published in 1560. In 1962, the story was transcribed in excerpts in the book, “Once Upon a Time: On the Nature of Fairy Tales,” written by the Swiss Folklorist Max Lüthi. From this book, which itself was translated from German, I discovered the story of The Little Earth-cow. 
 
  
 
 I found the story itself had never been published, in its entirety, in English. And so, with the help of my lovely German-Speaking Step-Mother Megan McLaughlin, and a 19th century edition of “Schwankbücher,” I was able to bring the story to English in its first complete edition.",Pit-ter-pat-ter,Louden House Tower,"Lexinington, Kentucky, USA",2023-03,2023-05,,CC BY 4.0
