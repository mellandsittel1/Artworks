## About the Collection

I am an artist / researcher based at the Univeristy of Iowa.

Research areas: knitting, bookbinding, historical labor practices (labors of the month), degrowth, weaving, simple and immediate printing (letterpress, block, risograph), baking and the labor of maintenance, papermaking

Lines of Inquiry 

How medieval people spent their leisure time, its extents and contents, the ways it’s written about, qualitative and quantitative data and artist-research creation

The use of cookbooks as primary sources for qualitative research on quality of life in comparative analysis
